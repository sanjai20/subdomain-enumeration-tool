# Subdomain Enumeration Tool

A Python-based subdomain discovery and reconnaissance tool designed for scanning single domains or performing bulk enumeration across the Tranco Top-1M domain list. Results are saved into a centralized SQLite database for powerful querying and analysis.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Install dependencies:

## üöÄ How to Use

### Single Domain Scan

Run the tool on one domain:

```powershell
python subdomain_enum.py example.com --https --ports 80,443
```

- `--https` ‚Üí scan both HTTP and HTTPS
- `--ports` ‚Üí scan custom ports (comma-separated)

Example output:

```
[+] http://www.example.com (200)
[+] https://www.example.com (200)
Saved CSV to results.csv
Saved JSON to results.json
```

### Bulk Scanning (Top 1 Million Domains)

Your tool supports bulk scans from the Tranco Top-1M list.

#### 1. Place your Tranco CSV file:

```
E:\subdomain_ennumeration_Project\top-1m.csv
```

#### 2. Edit bulk_scan.py

Set how many domains you wish to scan:

```python
domains = read_tranco_csv("top-1m.csv", limit=20)
```

#### 3. Run bulk scan:

```powershell
python bulk_scan.py
```

Results are saved as separate CSV/JSON files in:

```
bulk_results/
```

‚Ä¶and inserted into the SQLite database.

## üíæ Database Storage

All scan results are saved into:

```
subdomain_scans.db
```

Schema example:

| Field            | Description                      |

| length           | page size                         |
| title            | HTML title tag                    |
| content_hash     | SHA256 hash of page content       |
| server_header    | Server header                     |
| ssl_sans         | SSL Subject Alternative Names     |

## üîé Query Your Data

Example SQL queries:

### Show all successful subdomains

```sql
SELECT subdomain, url, status
FROM scan_results
WHERE status = 200;
```

---

### Find servers running Nginx

```sql
SELECT domain, subdomain, server_header
FROM scan_results
WHERE server_header LIKE '%nginx%';
```

---

### List subdomains with open ports

```sql
SELECT domain, subdomain, open_ports
FROM scan_results
WHERE open_ports IS NOT NULL AND open_ports <> '';
```

---

### Filter by specific domain

```sql
SELECT *
FROM scan_results
WHERE domain = 'facebook.com';
```
